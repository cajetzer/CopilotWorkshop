# Module 6: Copilot CLI — Speed in Your Terminal

## 📖 Overview

Bring Copilot to your shell. Ask for commands, generate scripts, and iterate quickly — without leaving the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- Installed GitHub Copilot CLI (or organizational equivalent)

## Estimated Time

- 20–30 minutes

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Use Copilot CLI to draft commands and scripts safely
- Apply a “dry‑run first” mindset for shell changes
- Convert ad‑hoc commands into shareable scripts

---

## 📚 Content

### Patterns for Safety

- Prefer read‑only commands first (list, show, diff)
- Add confirmations (`-n`, `--dry-run`) before write actions
- Pipe to `| cat` or `| less -R` to avoid pagers where needed

### From Command to Script

- Stabilize a one‑liner into a parameterized script
- Add usage, examples, and guardrails

---

## 🔨 Exercises

### Exercise 1: “Draft the Command” (Marcus)

#### 🎯 Objective

Ask Copilot to propose a command, then harden it.

#### 📋 Steps

1. Ask for a one‑liner to list all `.md` files and count lines.
2. Add flags to handle spaces and hidden folders safely.
3. Run and validate output.

#### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Safe command works on your repo
- [ ] Flags handle common edge cases

#### 💭 Marcus

“CLI + Copilot = fast, but safety first.”

---

### Exercise 2: “Script It” (Sarah)

#### 🎯 Objective

Turn a useful pipeline into a reusable script.

#### 📋 Steps

1. Take a frequent one‑liner and ask Copilot to draft a script.
2. Require parameters; add `--dry-run` and a confirmation prompt for mutating actions.
3. Add usage and two examples.

#### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Script includes usage, parameters, and dry‑run
- [ ] Mutating actions confirm before execution

#### 📚 Official Docs

- Copilot CLI docs: https://docs.github.com/copilot

#### 💭 Sarah

“Consistency improved once I scripted the workflow.”

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Draft with Copilot; ship with guardrails
- Convert one‑offs into scripts your team can share

### Aliases and Shortcuts

Create shell aliases for faster access:

**Bash/Zsh:**

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias gcs='gh copilot suggest'
alias gce='gh copilot explain'
```

**Fish:**

```fish
# Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
alias gcs='gh copilot suggest'
alias gce='gh copilot explain'
```

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Add to $PROFILE
Set-Alias -Name gcs -Value 'gh copilot suggest'
Set-Alias -Name gce -Value 'gh copilot explain'
```

**Usage:**

```bash
gcs "find large files"
gce "rm -rf /"
```

### Integration with Shell History

**View and Explain History:**

```bash
# Bash/Zsh
history | tail -5
gh copilot explain "$(history | tail -1 | sed 's/^[ ]*[0-9]*[ ]*//')"
```

**Run Suggested Commands:**

```bash
# Get suggestion and store
CMD=$(gh copilot suggest "list docker containers" --no-interactive)
# Review before executing
echo $CMD
# Execute if safe
eval $CMD
```

**⚠️ Safety Note:** Always review generated commands before execution, especially those involving:

- File deletion
- System modifications
- Network operations
- Permission changes

### Best Practices

**1. Be Specific:**

```bash
# ❌ Vague
gh copilot suggest "do git stuff"

# ✅ Specific
gh copilot suggest -t git "create a new branch and switch to it"
```

**2. Specify Context:**

```bash
# Include important details
gh copilot suggest "find all .log files modified in the last 7 days in /var/log"
```

**3. Use Appropriate Type:**

```bash
# Use -t git for Git commands
gh copilot suggest -t git "show files changed in last commit"

# Use -t gh for GitHub CLI
gh copilot suggest -t gh "list my pull requests"
```

**4. Review Before Running:**

```bash
# Always understand what the command does
gh copilot suggest "delete old log files"
# Then use explain to understand
gh copilot explain "find /var/log -name '*.log' -mtime +30 -delete"
```

# Module 9: GitHub Copilot CLI for Build & Test Workflows

## ⏰ 6:00 PM — Terminal Mastery

> *"I just spent 20 minutes running tests manually, fixing failures one by one, only to have CI fail on something I forgot to check. There has to be a better way."*  
> — Marcus, frustrated after another CI failure

---

## 📖 The Story

Marcus is stuck in a painful cycle:
1. Make changes
2. Manually run tests
3. Fix failures one by one
4. Push to CI
5. Discover he forgot to run linting
6. Fix, push again
7. Repeat

Jordan overhears Marcus cursing at his terminal: *"Want to see how I never have that problem? Let me show you what a CLI agent can do for your build/test cycle."*

What follows is a mentorship session where Jordan teaches Marcus the terminal workflows that make him 10x more productive—interactive AI sessions that handle testing, debugging, coverage checks, and pre-push validation.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Install and configure GitHub Copilot CLI for interactive agent sessions
- Debug test failures conversationally without reading stack traces manually
- Run smart test selection based on code changes
- Automate pre-push health checks to never break CI again
- Generate tests for new code through conversation
- Debug broken builds and dependencies interactively
- Drive test coverage improvements with agent assistance
- Create morning health check routines

**Time**: ~75-90 minutes  
**Primary Personas**: Jordan (DevOps Expert), Marcus (DevOps Developer)

## 💡 Why CLI for Build & Test?

**The Problem:** Developers spend hours in terminals running build/test commands manually:
- `npm test` → read failures → fix → repeat
- Forget to run linting before pushing
- CI catches issues your local checks missed
- Debugging broken builds means reading cryptic error messages

**The Solution:** An interactive AI agent in your terminal that:
- Understands test failures and explains them
- Runs only relevant tests for your changes
- Automates pre-push validation
- Generates tests conversationally
- Debugs build issues with you

---

## 🧠 Mindful Moment: The Terminal as Conversation

Traditional terminal use is command-response:
```bash
$ npm test
[wall of output]
$ # read, think, decide next command
$ npm test -- character.test.js
```

**CLI agent sessions are conversations:**
```bash
$ copilot
> Run tests for files I changed
[agent analyzes git diff, runs relevant tests]

> That test failed. Why?
[agent explains the failure]

> Fix it
[agent proposes changes]
```

You're not memorizing commands—you're describing intent.

## 📚 Key Concepts

### The Interactive Session Model

| Traditional CLI | GitHub Copilot CLI Agent |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| One command at a time | Multi-turn conversation |
| Read output manually | Agent explains results |
| Memorize syntax | Describe intent |
| Sequential execution | Iterative problem-solving |

### How It Works

1. **Start a session**: `copilot`
2. **Trust the directory**: Agent asks permission first time
3. **Converse naturally**: Describe what you want
4. **Approve actions**: Agent asks before executing
5. **Iterate**: Keep refining until done

### Tool Approval System

The agent will ask permission before:
- Running shell commands
- Modifying files
- Installing packages
- Pushing to git

You can approve per-action or for the session.

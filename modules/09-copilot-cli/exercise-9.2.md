# Exercise 9.2: Scripting CI/CD Automation

## 🔨 Exercise

### Exercise 9.2: Scripting CI/CD Automation — "From Interactive to Automated"

**Lead:** Marcus ⭐ | **Support:** David 🤝 | **Time:** 15 min

#### 📖 The Challenge

Pipeline failures are expensive. When the FanHub build breaks, Marcus spends 25 minutes manually investigating: checking test output, examining build logs, validating dependencies, and tracing configuration issues. The process involves 12 separate debugging steps—each requiring manual execution and interpretation. Worse, there's no pattern detection: the same root cause can manifest differently, requiring full investigation each time.

David reviews failed builds to ensure architectural standards aren't violated, but without automated analysis, he's dependent on Marcus's investigation notes. The manual handoff adds another 15 minutes and often misses subtle issues that only surface under specific conditions.

This exercise transforms the interactive CLI workflows from Exercise 9.1 into programmatic automation—enabling AI-powered build analysis that runs automatically on every pipeline failure, identifies patterns, and surfaces actionable fixes without human intervention.

#### 🔄 The Transformation

| Before ❌ | After ✨ |
|-----------|----------|
| Build fails at 2 AM. Marcus wakes up to Slack alert. SSHs into build server. Manually checks: test output (Jest failures?), build logs (compilation errors?), package.json (dependency conflicts?), Docker build (layer failures?), environment vars (missing configs?). After 12 separate checks, identifies issue was a missing peer dependency. Fixes and re-runs pipeline. | Build fails at 2 AM. Automated script runs: `copilot -p "Analyze build failure in /var/log/build.log and suggest fix" --allow-tool 'shell'`. CI system receives structured output: "Missing peer dependency: @testing-library/react@13.x required by @testing-library/user-event. Add to package.json." Marcus wakes up to fix already identified, implements in 2 minutes. |

#### 🎯 Your Goal

Create programmatic CLI automation scripts that analyze build failures automatically, reducing investigation time from 25 minutes to under 5 minutes and enabling integration into CI/CD pipelines.

#### 📋 Steps

1. **Create Programmatic Build Analyzer Script**
   
   Create a script that uses Copilot CLI in programmatic mode to analyze build failures:
   
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/CopilotTraining/fanhub
   mkdir -p scripts
   ```
   
   Create `scripts/analyze-build-failure.sh`:
   
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Programmatic Copilot CLI for automated build analysis
   # Usage: ./analyze-build-failure.sh <log-file-path>
   
   LOG_FILE=$1
   
   if [ -z "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
     echo "Usage: $0 <log-file-path>"
     exit 1
   fi
   
   if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
     echo "Error: Log file not found: $LOG_FILE"
     exit 1
   fi
   
   echo "🔍 Analyzing build failure with Copilot CLI..."
   echo ""
   
   # Use programmatic mode with --allow-tool for automated execution
   copilot -p "Analyze the build failure in $LOG_FILE. Identify:
   1. The root cause of the failure
   2. Which component failed (tests, build, dependencies, Docker)
   3. Specific files or configurations involved
   4. Concrete fix with commands to implement
   
   Provide structured output with severity and fix steps." --allow-tool 'shell'
   
   echo ""
   echo "✅ Analysis complete"
   ```
   
   Make it executable:
   
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/analyze-build-failure.sh
   ```
   
   **What you've created:** A programmatic script that can run in CI/CD pipelines without human interaction, automatically analyzing failures and generating actionable reports.

2. **Test the Script with a Real Build Failure**
   
   Introduce a deliberate build failure to test the automation:
   
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/CopilotTraining/fanhub/backend
   
   # Break the build by introducing a syntax error
   echo "const broken = {" >> src/index.js
   
   # Try to build and capture the output
   npm run build > /tmp/build-failure.log 2>&1 || true
   ```
   
   Now run your analyzer script:
   
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/CopilotTraining/fanhub
   ./scripts/analyze-build-failure.sh /tmp/build-failure.log
   ```
   
   **What to observe:**
   - Copilot CLI reads the log file automatically
   - Identifies the syntax error and specific line number
   - Suggests the exact fix (remove the incomplete line)
   - Provides structured output suitable for CI/CD consumption
   
   Fix the issue:
   
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Remove the broken line from src/index.js
   git restore src/index.js
   
   # Verify build works
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Create CI/CD Integration Pattern with Build Pipeline Analyzer**
   
   Create an enhanced script that integrates with the custom `build-pipeline-analyzer` skill from Module 5:
   
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/CopilotTraining/fanhub/scripts
   ```
   
   Create `scripts/ci-failure-handler.sh`:
   
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # CI/CD Build Failure Handler with Custom Agent
   # Integrates custom build-pipeline-analyzer skill for specialized analysis
   
   BUILD_LOG=${1:-"/tmp/build.log"}
   WORKSPACE="/workspaces/CopilotTraining/fanhub"
   
   echo "🚨 Build Failure Detected"
   echo "📊 Running automated analysis..."
   echo ""
   
   # Use programmatic mode with custom skill
   copilot -p "Using the build-pipeline-analyzer skill, analyze the build failure in $BUILD_LOG.
   
   Context: FanHub application (Node.js backend + React frontend)
   
   Provide:
   1. Failure classification (dependency, test, compilation, Docker)
   2. Root cause analysis
   3. Impact assessment (blocks deployment? breaks dev environment?)
   4. Fix recommendation with exact commands
   5. Prevention strategy (lint rule? test case? config validation?)
   
   Format output as structured markdown for Slack notification." \
   --allow-tool 'shell'
   
   echo ""
   echo "📝 Analysis saved for team review"
   echo "💡 Tip: Review output and implement suggested fix"
   ```
   
   Make it executable and test with the test log:
   
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/ci-failure-handler.sh
   ./scripts/ci-failure-handler.sh /tmp/build-failure.log
   ```
   
   **What you've built:** A CI/CD-ready script that:
   - Runs automatically when builds fail
   - Uses custom agent skills for specialized analysis
   - Generates structured output for notifications (Slack, email, GitHub comments)
   - Provides prevention strategies, not just immediate fixes

## 🔗 What You Built

**In this exercise:**
- `scripts/analyze-build-failure.sh` — Programmatic build failure analysis for automated pipelines
- `scripts/ci-failure-handler.sh` — CI/CD-integrated failure handler with custom skill support
- **Automated investigation pattern** — Reduces 25-minute manual debugging to 5-minute automated analysis

**How it compounds:**

| Previous Modules | This Module | Combined Power |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Custom agents (Module 7) | Programmatic CLI scripts | Agents now run in CI/CD pipelines automatically |
| Build analyzer skill (Module 5) | CI failure handler | Specialized build analysis integrated into deployment automation |
| Interactive debugging (Exercise 9.1) | Scripted automation | Same intelligence, zero human interaction required |

**Marcus's outcome:** Build failures now trigger automated analysis that identifies root causes, suggests fixes, and provides prevention strategies—all before he even sees the failure notification. Investigation time: 25→5 minutes. After-hours pages: 8-12→2-3 per month.

# Module 7: Custom Agents — THE PAYOFF

## ⏰ Monday 5:00 PM — The Moment Everything Clicks

> *"We've spent all day building context—instructions, prompts, custom instructions, skills, MCP connections. Now let's see what an agent can do with ALL of that in place."*  
> — David, ready for the payoff

## 🎉 This Is the Payoff

**Think about what you've built today:**

| Module | What You Added | What Copilot Gained |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Module 1** | Repository Instructions | Project context |
| **Module 2** | Plan Mode | Systematic thinking |
| **Module 3** | Custom Prompts | Task templates |
| **Module 4** | Custom Instructions | File-specific patterns |
| **Module 5** | Agent Skills | Domain expertise |
| **Module 6** | MCP Servers | External system access |

**Now, in Module 7**, you'll create an autonomous agent that uses **ALL of this** to build the Character Detail v2 feature—episodes, quotes, related characters, favorites.

Early this morning, Copilot gave generic suggestions. Now? Watch what happens when an agent has complete context.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the difference between Chat, Edit, and Agent modes
- Create custom agents with specialized capabilities  
- Experience the "payoff" of layered customization
- Use agent mode with full context (instructions + skills + MCP)
- Watch an agent build a complete feature autonomously

**Time**: ~60 minutes  
**Personas**: David (Architect), Marcus (Platform Engineer), Marcus (DevOps)

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Copilot Modes

VS Code Copilot has three modes:

1. **Ask Mode** (Default)
   - Conversational Q&A
   - Explains code, answers questions
   - You apply suggestions manually

2. **Edit Mode**
   - Direct file manipulation
   - Copilot proposes changes
   - You review diff before accepting

3. **Agent Mode**
   - Autonomous problem-solving
   - Can create files, run commands, iterate
   - Works until task is complete or blocked

### Custom Agents

You can create specialized agents that:
- Have specific instructions and context
- Use designated tools and capabilities
- Focus on particular domains (testing, security, DevOps)

### The Payoff Formula

```
Agent + Instructions + Skills + MCP = AMAZING Results
```

**Without context** (Module 1): Agent makes generic suggestions  
**With full context** (Module 7): Agent builds complete features correctly

## 🧠 Mindful Moment: From Assistant to Colleague

Think about the evolution:

| Era | Interaction | Who Does the Work |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| **Chat** | Q&A | Human orchestrates, AI suggests |
| **Edit** | Direct manipulation | AI makes targeted changes |
| **Agent** | Delegation | AI works autonomously, human reviews |

We're moving from "Copilot answers my questions" to "Copilot solves my problems."

The key insight: **Trust is earned through transparency.** Agents work autonomously, but they show their work. You review before accepting.

---

## 🎭 Behind the Scenes: How Agents Work

### The Agent Loop

When you use Agent Mode, here's what happens:

1. **Planning**: Agent analyzes your request and workspace
2. **Execution**: Agent takes actions (create files, edit code, run commands)
3. **Observation**: Agent checks the results of its actions
4. **Iteration**: If something failed, agent tries to fix it
5. **Completion**: Agent reports results for your review

### Tool Use

Agents have access to "tools" that let them:
- Read files from your workspace
- Create new files
- Edit existing files
- Run terminal commands
- Search the web (with permission)
- **Query databases via MCP** (configured in Module 6!)

### Trust Boundaries

Agents ask permission before:
- Running destructive commands
- Making changes outside the workspace
- Accessing external services

This is the balance: autonomous enough to be useful, controlled enough to be safe.

## ✅ Module Checklist

Before moving to Module 8, verify:

- [ ] Understand the difference between Chat, Edit, and Agent modes
- [ ] Successfully used Agent Mode for a complete task
- [ ] Witnessed the "payoff" — agent using full context to build Character Detail v2
- [ ] Created at least one custom agent
- [ ] Understand when to use agents vs interactive chat
- [ ] Reviewed agent-generated code before accepting

---

## 🔗 Compounding Value

**What we create in this module:**
- Experience with Agent Mode workflows
- `architecture-reviewer.agent.md` — Custom review agent
- `devops-reviewer.agent.md` — Infrastructure review agent
- **Character Detail v2** — The golden thread feature, built with full context

> 📂 **Compare Your Work**: See [`examples/completed-config/.github/agents/`](../../examples/completed-config/.github/agents/) for reference agent implementations.

**Artifacts from previous modules we use:**
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Referenced by agents (Module 1)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Agent behavior patterns (Module 1)
- Custom prompts — Foundation for agent instructions (Module 3)
- Custom instructions — File-specific patterns (Module 4)
- Agent Skills — Domain expertise (Module 5)
- MCP servers — Database access (Module 6)

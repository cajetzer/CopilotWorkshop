> 💡 **Philosophy Connection**: The "Markdown Whisperer" era is about building **maintainable systems through clarity**. As discussed in [Module 0, Part B](../00-orientation/README.md#part-b-why-this-training-exists--the-evolution-of-enterprise-programming), clarity today prevents chaos tomorrow. These best practices ensure AI assistance makes your codebase better over time, not just faster in the moment.

### Prompt Checklist

- Goal, Constraints, Context, Output
- Example + Non‑example
- Scope: selection → file → workspace

### Change Checklist

- Small diffs; behavior preserved unless stated
- Tests updated/added; docs linked
- Risk callouts and roll‑back plan

### Review Checklist

- Does it follow docs/PATTERNS.md and docs/CONVENTIONS.md?
- Are inputs validated and errors handled?
- Any logging/telemetry needs?

### Team Conventions

- Keep architecture/patterns/conventions docs short and current
- Add `.github/copilot-workspace-hints.md` to route answers
- Capture “AI got it wrong” examples to improve prompts

### Measuring Impact

- Track PR review time, test coverage trends, change failure rate
- Compare before/after for a small team over 2–4 weeks

## 📚 Content

### Effective Prompting Strategies

**Be Specific and Clear:**

❌ **Vague:**

```javascript
// function to process data
```

✅ **Specific:**

```javascript
// function to validate and sanitize user email addresses
// returns true if valid, false otherwise
// handles international domains and subdomains
```

**Provide Context:**

❌ **No Context:**

```python
def calculate():
```

✅ **With Context:**

```python
# Shopping cart calculator
# Calculates total price including:
# - base price of items
# - applicable tax based on location
# - shipping costs based on weight
# - discount codes if provided
def calculate_order_total(items, tax_rate, shipping_weight, discount_code=None):
```

**Use Natural Language:**

```javascript
// Create an async function that fetches user data from the API,
// caches it in Redis for 5 minutes, and handles network errors gracefully
// If cache exists, return cached data
// If API fails, return default user object and log error
```

**Iterative Refinement:**

```javascript
// Step 1: Basic function
// function to send email

// Step 2: Add details
// function to send welcome email to new users with HTML template

// Step 3: Add requirements
// function to send welcome email with:
// - HTML template from templates/welcome.html
// - personalized greeting using user's first name
// - error handling with retry logic (3 attempts)
// - logging of success/failure
```

- [Security best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/reviewing-audit-logs-for-copilot-business)

### Security Considerations

**Code Review Vigilance:**

```javascript
// ❌ Potential SQL injection - Review carefully
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${userEmail}'`;

// ✅ Use parameterized queries
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?";
db.query(query, [userEmail]);
```

**Secret Management:**

```javascript
// ❌ Never commit secrets
const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123...";

// ✅ Use environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

**Input Validation:**

```javascript
// Always validate Copilot-generated validation logic
function validateEmail(email) {
  // Review regex patterns carefully
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}
```

**Dependency Security:**

- Review suggested dependencies
- Check for known vulnerabilities
- Verify package authenticity
- Keep dependencies updated

**Security Checklist:**

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Proper error handling (no info leakage)
- [ ] Access control checks
- [ ] Secure communication (HTTPS)

### Code Quality Best Practices

**Always Review:**

- Read generated code carefully
- Understand what it does
- Test edge cases
- Verify error handling
- Check performance implications

**Test Thoroughly:**

```javascript
// Don't just accept generated tests - verify they're meaningful
describe("User Service", () => {
  // Ensure tests actually test behavior, not implementation
  it("should create user with valid data", async () => {
    // Verify test data is realistic
    // Check assertions are meaningful
    // Ensure cleanup happens
  });
});
```

**Maintain Consistency:**

- Follow project coding standards
- Match existing patterns
- Use consistent naming
- Apply team conventions

**Documentation Standards:**

- Verify accuracy of generated docs
- Ensure completeness
- Check for outdated information
- Maintain consistent style

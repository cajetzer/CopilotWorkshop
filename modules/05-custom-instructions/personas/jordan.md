# Jordan's Path: Custom Instructions

## 🎯 Your Focus: Security and DevOps Patterns by Default

Jordan, this module lets you do what you've always wanted—make security and DevOps best practices **automatic**. Instead of being the "did you run as non-root?" reviewer on every PR, you'll create instructions that ensure Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions, and infrastructure code follow your patterns from the start.

**Your exercises**: 5.3 (Infrastructure Instructions)  
**Time**: ~25 minutes  
**Theme**: Security and operational excellence by default

## Exercise 5.3: Infrastructure Instructions — "Jordan's DevOps Patterns"

### 📖 The Story

**Jordan** (Platform Engineer, 12 years) maintains the CI/CD pipelines, Dockerfiles, and infrastructure config. These files need specialized knowledge:
- Dockerfiles have security best practices
- GitHub Actions have workflow patterns
- Terraform has module conventions

*"Application developers mean well, but they don't know Docker security. I want Copilot to enforce our infra patterns automatically."*

### ❌ The "Before" — What Frustration Looks Like

**Last Week's Incident Report:**

A PR merged with a Dockerfile that:
- Used `FROM node:latest` (unpinned version)
- Ran as root user
- Had no health check
- Included dev dependencies in production image

Jordan was on vacation. The PR looked small. Security scan caught it... in production.

**Jordan's Typical PR Comments:**
- "Please pin the base image version"
- "Add `USER nonroot` - never run containers as root"
- "Include a HEALTHCHECK instruction"
- "Use multi-stage build to exclude dev dependencies"

*"I've written these comments hundreds of times,"* Jordan sighs. *"If only the AI knew this from the start."*

### 🎯 Objective

Create specialized instructions for infrastructure and deployment files.

### 📋 Steps

1. **Create infrastructure instructions**
   
   Create: `.github/instructions/infrastructure.instructions.md`
   
   ````markdown
   ---
   applyTo:
     - "Dockerfile*"
     - "docker-compose*.yml"
     - ".github/workflows/**"
     - "**/terraform/**"
     - "**/k8s/**"
     - "**/*.tf"
   ---
   
   # Infrastructure & DevOps Standards
   
   When generating or modifying infrastructure files, follow these security and operational best practices.
   
   ## Dockerfile Best Practices
   
   ### Security
   
   ```dockerfile
   # ✅ Use specific version tags, not 'latest'
   FROM node:20.10-alpine
   
   # ✅ Run as non-root user
   RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
   USER appuser
   
   # ✅ Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
   FROM node:20.10-alpine AS builder
   # ... build steps ...
   
   FROM node:20.10-alpine AS runtime
   COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app/dist
   ```
   
   ### Optimization
   
   ```dockerfile
   # ✅ Order layers from least to most frequently changed
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm ci --only=production
   COPY . .
   
   # ✅ Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
   # ✅ Combine RUN commands to reduce layers
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
       package1 \
       package2 \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```
   
   ### Health Checks
   
   ```dockerfile
   # Always include health checks
   HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
     CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
   ```
   
   ## GitHub Actions Patterns
   
   ### Workflow Structure
   
   ```yaml
   name: Descriptive Workflow Name
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
     pull_request:
       branches: [main]
   
   concurrency:
     group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
     cancel-in-progress: true
   
   jobs:
     job-name:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       timeout-minutes: 15  # Always set timeout
       
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         
         - name: Setup Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: '20'
             cache: 'npm'
   ```
   
   ### Security
   
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Pin action versions to SHA
   - uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11
   
   # ✅ Minimize permissions
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pull-requests: write
   
   # ✅ Use secrets, never hardcode
   env:
     API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
   ```
   
   ## Environment Variables
   
   - Never commit secrets to repository
   - Use `.env.example` for documentation
   - Different configs for dev/staging/prod
   - Validate required env vars at startup
   
   ## Terraform Patterns
   
   ```hcl
   # Use consistent naming
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_assets" {
     bucket = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-assets"
     
     tags = {
       Environment = var.environment
       Project     = var.project_name
       ManagedBy   = "terraform"
     }
   }
   
   # Always use variables, not hardcoded values
   # Always tag resources
   # Use modules for reusable patterns
   ```
   
   ## Security Checklist
   
   Before merging infrastructure changes:
   - [ ] No secrets in code
   - [ ] Containers run as non-root
   - [ ] Images use specific versions
   - [ ] Permissions are minimized
   - [ ] Health checks are defined
   - [ ] Timeouts are configured
   - [ ] Resources are tagged
   ````

2. **Test with a Dockerfile request**
   
   ```
   Create a Dockerfile for a Node.js Express application that:
   - Builds the TypeScript code
   - Runs in production mode
   - Is optimized for size and security
   ```
   
   Verify: Non-root user, multi-stage build, pinned versions, health check.

3. **Test with a GitHub Actions request**
   
   ```
   Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
   - Runs on push to main and PRs
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs linting and tests
   - Builds the application
   - Deploys to staging on main push
   ```
   
   Verify: Concurrency, timeout, pinned actions, secrets usage.

### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Created `.github/instructions/infrastructure.instructions.md`
- [ ] `applyTo` includes Dockerfile, workflows, terraform patterns
- [ ] Generated Dockerfiles follow security patterns
- [ ] GitHub Actions include timeouts and concurrency
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in generated code

### ✨ The "After" — The Improved Experience

Jordan's DevOps expertise is always available:

**Before**: Review every Dockerfile for "did they run as root?"  
**After**: Non-root user is automatic

**New Developer Submits Dockerfile PR:**

The AI-generated Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:20.10-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20.10-alpine AS runtime
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
USER appuser
EXPOSE 3000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Jordan's review: *"Ship it."* ✅

**Security improvement**: Infrastructure files are secure by default

## 🚀 Challenge Extension: Environment-Specific Instructions

Create instructions for different environments:

**Production Configs** (`.github/instructions/production.instructions.md`):
```markdown
---
applyTo:
  - "**/prod/**"
  - "**/*.prod.*"
  - "**/production/**"
---

# Production Configuration Standards

- Always enable all security headers
- Require authentication on all endpoints
- Enable comprehensive logging
- Configure alerts for error rates > 1%
- Use read replicas for database queries
```

**Development Configs** (`.github/instructions/development.instructions.md`):
```markdown
---
applyTo:
  - "**/dev/**"
  - "**/*.dev.*"
  - "**/local/**"
---

# Development Configuration Standards

- Enable hot reload
- Use local database (never connect to prod)
- Enable verbose logging for debugging
- Disable authentication for local testing (optional)
```

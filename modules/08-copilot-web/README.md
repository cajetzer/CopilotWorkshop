# Module 8: GitHub.com Copilot for Product Management

## ⏰ 3:30 PM — Bridging Product and Engineering

> *"I've been writing requirements for years, but I never feel connected to the actual implementation until it's too late. By the time I see the feature, it's already shipped—and gaps are expensive to fix."*  
> — Rafael, reviewing Character Detail v2 from his browser

---

## 📖 The Story

The team just completed Character Detail v2 using custom agents in Module 07. Now Rafael needs to:

- **Validate delivery** — Does the implementation match what was promised?
- **Update documentation** — Users need to know about new features
- **Answer stakeholders** — The portfolio manager is asking about timeline overruns
- **Plan next sprint** — Which issues should the team tackle next?

Rafael doesn't have VS Code installed. He doesn't need it. **GitHub.com Copilot** gives him everything required to stay connected to delivery—right from his browser.

> *"Wait, I can validate a PR against requirements without setting up a dev environment?"*  
> — Rafael, discovering GitHub.com Copilot

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Transform vague feature requests into well-structured GitHub Issues using Copilot
- Validate PR implementations against original requirements using PR summaries
- Update user documentation quickly using GitHub.com's web editor with Copilot
- Translate technical complexity into business-friendly stakeholder communication
- Use Copilot to analyze backlog patterns for data-informed prioritization

**Time**: ~50-60 minutes  
**Primary Personas**: Rafael (Product Manager), David (Architect)  
**GitHub Copilot Tier**: Enterprise (required for PR summaries and full chat)

---

## 💡 Enterprise Requirement

> **Note**: This module focuses on GitHub Copilot Enterprise features available on GitHub.com. While some exercises can be adapted for Business tier, PR summaries and full Copilot Chat on GitHub.com require Enterprise.

## 🧠 Mindful Moment: Proximity to Implementation

Product managers often feel disconnected from technical delivery. Requirements go in, features come out—but the middle is a black box.

**GitHub.com Copilot changes this equation.** By enabling PMs to:
- Review PRs with AI-assisted explanations
- Validate implementations against requirements in real-time
- Communicate technical details without deep code knowledge

...you stay **proximate to implementation** without needing a local development environment.

## David — The Seasoned Architect

**Experience:** 20 years

### Background

- Staff engineer, has seen technologies come and go
- Built his career on syntax mastery and deep language knowledge
- Remembers when knowing obscure language corners made you invaluable
- Skeptical of tools that claim to replace expertise

### Goals

- Understand if Copilot is genuinely useful or just fancy autocomplete
- Find ways AI can enhance (not replace) his architectural thinking
- Stay current without abandoning hard-earned expertise

### Fears

- **That AI will make his expertise obsolete** — If anyone can generate code, what's his value?
- **Being replaced by junior developers with AI tools** — Will companies decide they don't need expensive senior engineers?
- **Losing the craft** — Programming as an intellectual pursuit, not just prompt engineering
- **His knowledge becoming a liability** — Patterns he knows deeply might be "automated away"

### Voice in Exercises

Evaluative, analytical, impressed by genuine capability, dismissive of hype. Needs to see that Copilot respects and augments expertise rather than replacing it.

## Elena — The Quality Champion

**Experience:** 8 years

### Background

- Senior QA Engineer who transitioned from manual to automation testing
- Expert in testing frameworks (Jest, Pytest, Selenium, Playwright)
- Passionate about shift-left testing and test-driven development
- Bridges the gap between development and quality assurance teams

### Goals

- Create comprehensive test suites faster without sacrificing coverage
- Generate meaningful test cases that catch edge cases humans might miss
- Automate repetitive test creation so she can focus on test strategy
- Help developers write better tests from the start

### Fears

- AI-generated tests that look complete but miss critical scenarios
- Losing the thoughtful analysis that makes testing effective
- Tests that pass but don't actually validate business requirements
- Becoming a "test generator operator" instead of a quality strategist

### Voice in Exercises

Methodical, detail-oriented, always asking "but what about...?" Appreciates tools that enhance coverage but insists on understanding what's being tested and why.

## Rafael — The Product Visionary

**Experience:** 10 years

### Background

- Product Manager who started as a developer before moving to product
- Manages a portfolio of features for an enterprise SaaS platform
- Constantly balancing stakeholder requests, technical debt, and innovation
- Speaks both "business" and "technical" fluently

### Goals

- Quickly understand technical implications of new requirements
- Prioritize backlog items based on effort vs. value analysis
- Communicate more effectively with development teams
- Use AI to accelerate requirement refinement and story writing

### Fears

- Misunderstanding technical complexity and over-promising to stakeholders
- Creating requirements that sound good but are vague or contradictory
- Losing touch with the technical details that inform good product decisions
- AI-generated specs that miss the nuance of what users actually need

### Voice in Exercises

Strategic, outcome-focused, always connecting work to user value. Appreciates when tools help bridge the communication gap between business needs and technical implementation.

## Jordan — The DevOps Expert

**Experience:** 12 years

### Background

- Platform Engineer responsible for CI/CD pipelines and deployment infrastructure
- Deep expertise in GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Terraform, and Kubernetes
- Automates everything—if it can be scripted, it should be
- Champions "you build it, you run it" culture across the organization

### Goals

- Accelerate pipeline development and reduce YAML debugging time
- Generate Infrastructure as Code faster while maintaining best practices
- Create self-service templates that development teams can adopt
- Use AI to document and explain complex deployment configurations

### Fears

- AI-generated configs that look right but have security vulnerabilities
- Losing the deep understanding of what pipelines actually do
- Creating technical debt through copy-paste infrastructure
- Junior engineers deploying AI-generated infrastructure without understanding it

### Voice in Exercises

Pragmatic, automation-first, always thinking about scale and repeatability. Appreciates tools that reduce toil but insists on understanding the "why" behind every configuration.

## The FanHub Team

In this workshop, these seven personas work together to build FanHub—a TV show fan site—in a 9-10 hour sprint. Each persona has a specific role and transformation arc:

| Persona | Primary Role | Modules Featured | Key Transformation |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Sarah** | Sprint lead, skeptic | 0, 2, 9 | From "prove it" to "I'm convinced" |
| **David** | Architecture, code review | 1, 2, 4, 7, 9 | From "will AI replace me?" to "AI amplifies me" |
| **Marcus** | DevOps → application code | 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 | From infrastructure-only to full-stack confident |
| **Priya** | Learning, UI implementation | 1, 5, 9 | From intimidated to empowered learner |
| **Elena** | Testing, quality assurance | 3, 5, 6, 9 | From AI-skeptical QA to AI-assisted QA |
| **Rafael** | Product, specifications | 3, 6, 7, 9 | From requirements writer to execution enabler |
| **Jordan** | Platform, deployment | 5, 8, 9 | From manual ops to documented automation |

### The Story Arc

**Monday 9:00 AM**: Sarah challenges the team to ship a production-ready fan site by end of day. The codebase is messy, undocumented, and Copilot gives generic suggestions.

**Monday 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM**: Through Modules 1-9, the team progressively adds customization—starting with plan mode thinking, then instructions, prompts, agents, custom instructions, custom skills, web workflows, CLI automation, and finally full integration. Each addition compounds the others. Module 9 concludes with shipping and reflection.

**The Transformation**: By the end, each persona has grown:
- Sarah realizes structured AI collaboration delivers real value
- David discovers AI amplifies his 20 years of architectural experience  
- Marcus gains full-stack confidence through systematic AI workflows
- Priya learns faster because AI explains as it generates
- Elena integrates AI into quality assurance without sacrificing rigor
- Rafael bridges requirements and implementation more effectively through domain skills
- Jordan creates documented, systematic automation workflows
- The whole team works more effectively together

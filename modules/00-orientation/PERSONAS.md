# Training Personas

Throughout this training, you'll encounter six personas who represent real archetypes of professionals at various career stages. These personas help surface realistic situations, concerns, and tradeoffs you might face when adopting GitHub Copilot.

Understanding these personas will help you:

- Connect with the exercises and scenarios
- Recognize your own hopes and concerns
- See how developers with different backgrounds approach AI-assisted development

---

## Sarah — The Skeptical Senior

**Experience:** 15 years

### Background

- Senior developer at a financial services company
- Survived multiple technology hype cycles
- Deep expertise in established languages (C#, Java)
- Values proven approaches over trendy tools
- Equally comfortable with architecture, standards enforcement, and hands-on implementation

### Goals

- Verify that Copilot delivers real value with concrete ROI metrics
- Find ways to accelerate her work without compromising quality
- Validate that AI can scale her 15 years of expertise across the team
- Document patterns once and enforce them automatically
- Maintain her relevance while embracing tools that prove their worth

### Fears

- Wasting time on tools that don't deliver measurable value
- Losing the craftsmanship aspect of coding to over-automation
- Being forced to change workflows that already work efficiently
- Tools that promise magic but create more work than they save

### Voice in Exercises

Skeptical but open-minded. Needs to be convinced with concrete demonstrations and quantifiable metrics, not promises. Focuses on ROI, time saved, and consistency improvements. Validates through experimentation and evidence.

## Marcus — The DevOps Developer

**Experience:** 5 years

### Background

- Started career focused on build systems and local developer workflows
- Expert with build tools, debuggers, test runners, and dev environment setup
- Makes developers productive by removing friction from their daily workflows
- Learns by doing, prefers practical examples

### Goals

- Accelerate build times and streamline debugging workflows
- Automate repetitive local development tasks
- Create testing workflows that developers actually use
- Enable the team to work more efficiently through better tooling

### Fears

- Building tools that developers work around instead of use
- Local workflows breaking and blocking the entire team
- Spending more time maintaining automation than it saves
- Being seen as "just the build person" rather than a productivity multiplier

### Voice in Exercises

Eager to learn, appreciates practical tips, responds well to "here's the workflow" guidance.

## David — The Seasoned Architect

**Experience:** 20 years

### Background

- Staff engineer, has seen technologies come and go
- Built his career on syntax mastery and deep language knowledge
- Remembers when knowing obscure language corners made you invaluable
- Skeptical of tools that claim to replace expertise

### Goals

- Understand if Copilot is genuinely useful or just fancy autocomplete
- Find ways AI can enhance (not replace) his architectural thinking
- Stay current without abandoning hard-earned expertise

### Fears

- **That AI will make his expertise obsolete** — If anyone can generate code, what's his value?
- **Being replaced by junior developers with AI tools** — Will companies decide they don't need expensive senior engineers?
- **Losing the craft** — Programming as an intellectual pursuit, not just prompt engineering
- **His knowledge becoming a liability** — Patterns he knows deeply might be "automated away"

### Voice in Exercises

Evaluative, analytical, impressed by genuine capability, dismissive of hype. Needs to see that Copilot respects and augments expertise rather than replacing it.

## Elena — The Quality Champion

**Experience:** 8 years

### Background

- Senior QA Engineer who transitioned from manual to automation testing
- Expert in testing frameworks (Jest, Pytest, Selenium, Playwright)
- Passionate about shift-left testing and test-driven development
- Bridges the gap between development and quality assurance teams

### Goals

- Create comprehensive test suites faster without sacrificing coverage
- Generate meaningful test cases that catch edge cases humans might miss
- Automate repetitive test creation so she can focus on test strategy
- Help developers write better tests from the start

### Fears

- AI-generated tests that look complete but miss critical scenarios
- Losing the thoughtful analysis that makes testing effective
- Tests that pass but don't actually validate business requirements
- Becoming a "test generator operator" instead of a quality strategist

### Voice in Exercises

Methodical, detail-oriented, always asking "but what about...?" Appreciates tools that enhance coverage but insists on understanding what's being tested and why.

## Rafael — The Product Visionary

**Experience:** 10 years

### Background

- Product Manager who started as a developer before moving to product
- Manages a portfolio of features for an enterprise SaaS platform
- Constantly balancing stakeholder requests, technical debt, and innovation
- Speaks both "business" and "technical" fluently

### Goals

- Quickly understand technical implications of new requirements
- Prioritize backlog items based on effort vs. value analysis
- Communicate more effectively with development teams
- Use AI to accelerate requirement refinement and story writing

### Fears

- Misunderstanding technical complexity and over-promising to stakeholders
- Creating requirements that sound good but are vague or contradictory
- Losing touch with the technical details that inform good product decisions
- AI-generated specs that miss the nuance of what users actually need

### Voice in Exercises

Strategic, outcome-focused, always connecting work to user value. Appreciates when tools help bridge the communication gap between business needs and technical implementation.

## The FanHub Team

In this workshop, these six personas work together to build FanHub—a TV show fan site—in a 9-10 hour sprint. Each persona has a specific role and transformation arc:

| Persona | Primary Role | Key Transformation |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Sarah** | Sprint lead, standards enforcement, implementation | From "prove it" to "I'm convinced" |
| **David** | Architecture, code review | From "will AI replace me?" to "AI amplifies me" |
| **Marcus** | DevOps & infrastructure | From infrastructure-only to full-stack confident |
| **Elena** | Testing, quality assurance | From AI-skeptical QA to AI-assisted QA |
| **Rafael** | Product, specifications | From requirements writer to execution enabler |

### The Story Arc

**Monday 9:00 AM**: Sarah challenges the team to ship a production-ready fan site by end of day. The codebase is messy, undocumented, and Copilot gives generic suggestions.

**Monday 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM**: Through Modules 1-9, the team progressively adds customization—starting with plan mode thinking, then instructions, prompts, agents, custom instructions, Agent Skills, web workflows, CLI automation, and finally full integration. Each addition compounds the others. Module 9 concludes with shipping and reflection.

**The Transformation**: By the end, each persona has grown:
- Sarah validates that AI scales her expertise through concrete ROI metrics—time saved, violations eliminated, review cycles reduced
- David discovers AI amplifies his 20 years of architectural experience  
- Marcus gains full-stack confidence and masters deployment automation through systematic AI workflows
- Elena integrates AI into quality assurance without sacrificing rigor
- Rafael bridges requirements and implementation more effectively through domain skills
- The whole team works more effectively together

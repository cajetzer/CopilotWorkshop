# Module 4: Custom Agents

## ⏰ Monday 1:30 PM — Autonomous Assistance

> *"I've been asking Copilot questions all morning. What if I could tell it: 'Go solve this problem, and let me know when you're done?'"*  
> — David, imagining a world where AI handles the tedious parts

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Copilot Modes

VS Code Copilot has three modes:

1. **Ask Mode** (Default)
   - Conversational Q&A
   - Explains code, answers questions
   - You apply suggestions manually

2. **Edit Mode**
   - Direct file manipulation
   - Copilot proposes changes
   - You review diff before accepting

3. **Agent Mode**
   - Autonomous problem-solving
   - Can create files, run commands, iterate
   - Works until task is complete or blocked

### Custom Agents

You can create specialized agents that:
- Have specific instructions and context
- Use designated tools and capabilities
- Focus on particular domains (testing, security, DevOps)

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP extends what agents can do:
- Connect to external data sources
- Run specialized tools
- Access services beyond the code editor

### Copilot CLI

The new Copilot CLI brings AI agent capabilities to your terminal:
- **Interactive mode** — Start with `copilot` for conversations
- **Task execution** — Make file changes, run commands, create PRs
- **GitHub integration** — Work with issues, PRs, and workflows
- **Programmatic mode** — Use `-p` for scripted automation

> 📘 See [Module 9: GitHub Copilot CLI](../09-copilot-cli/README.md) for full coverage.

## 🧠 Mindful Moment: From Assistant to Colleague

Think about the evolution:

| Era | Interaction | Who Does the Work |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| **Chat** | Q&A | Human orchestrates, AI suggests |
| **Edit** | Direct manipulation | AI makes targeted changes |
| **Agent** | Delegation | AI works autonomously, human reviews |

We're moving from "Copilot answers my questions" to "Copilot solves my problems."

The key insight: **Trust is earned through transparency.** Agents work autonomously, but they show their work. You review before accepting.

## 🎭 Behind the Scenes: How Agents Work

### The Agent Loop

When you use Agent Mode, here's what happens:

1. **Planning**: Agent analyzes your request and workspace
2. **Execution**: Agent takes actions (create files, edit code, run commands)
3. **Observation**: Agent checks the results of its actions
4. **Iteration**: If something failed, agent tries to fix it
5. **Completion**: Agent reports results for your review

### Tool Use

Agents have access to "tools" that let them:
- Read files from your workspace
- Create new files
- Edit existing files
- Run terminal commands
- Search the web (with permission)

### Trust Boundaries

Agents ask permission before:
- Running destructive commands
- Making changes outside the workspace
- Accessing external services

This is the balance: autonomous enough to be useful, controlled enough to be safe.

## ➡️ Next Up

**[Module 5: Custom Instructions](../05-custom-instructions/README.md)** (Monday 2:30 PM)

The backend is solid. Standards are established. Agents are working. Now it's time to add file-scoped intelligence—instructions that activate automatically based on file patterns.

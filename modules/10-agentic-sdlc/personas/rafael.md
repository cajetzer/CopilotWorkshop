# Rafael's Path: Agentic SDLC

## 🎯 Your Focus: Strategic Orchestration of Parallel Development

Rafael, this module completes your transformation from requirements writer to **execution enabler**. You'll learn to prioritize work based on business value, decompose it into parallelizable streams, and orchestrate multiple agents simultaneously to maximize output.

**Your exercise**: 5.5 (Sprint Orchestration)  
**Time**: ~25 minutes  
**Theme**: From writing requirements to orchestrating execution

## Exercise 5.5: Sprint Orchestration — "Rafael Directs the Symphony"

### 📖 The Story

It's Monday, 4:00 PM. **Sarah** gathers the team for sprint planning:

*"We have 90 minutes left in the day. What are we building?"*

**Rafael** opens the backlog. There are 8 feature requests, 3 bug fixes, and 2 tech debt items. Everyone starts talking at once—each person advocating for their priority.

**Sarah** looks at Rafael: *"You're the product lead. What moves the needle for tomorrow's demo?"*

Rafael realizes: **This is his moment to demonstrate strategic thinking + AI orchestration.** He needs to:
1. Prioritize based on business value and demo impact
2. Estimate what's achievable in 90 minutes
3. Decompose work into parallelizable streams
4. Assign the right interface/person to each task
5. Keep everyone focused on shipping

### ❌ The "Before" — What Frustration Looks Like

Without strategic orchestration:

**4:00 PM**: Team works on whatever seems important
- David refactors architecture (complex, no visible demo impact)
- Elena writes tests (important, but not demo material)
- Jordan optimizes deployment (won't be visible in demo)
- Marcus starts search (too big for 90 minutes)

**5:30 PM**: Nothing shippable. Everyone worked hard, no coherent outcome.

**Result**: Demo tomorrow shows "in-progress" work. Stakeholders ask: "What did you actually ship?"

### 🎯 Objective

Use product judgment + AI orchestration to prioritize work, decompose it into parallel streams, and ship high-value features in 90 minutes.

### 📋 Steps

1. **Create a prioritization matrix**
   
   Ask Copilot:
   ```
   @workspace We have 90 minutes until end of day and a demo tomorrow.
   
   Help me prioritize this backlog:
   
   Features:
   1. Search (all shows, characters, quotes with autocomplete)
   2. Character favorites page
   3. Analytics dashboard (views, popular quotes, trending)
   4. Social media sharing
   
   Tech Debt:
   1. Refactor circular dependencies
   2. Fix character duplication bug
   
   For each item, estimate:
   - Effort (Small/Medium/Large)
   - Demo impact (High/Medium/Low)
   - Risk (breaking changes, dependencies)
   
   Recommend what to build NOW vs. defer.
   ```

2. **Make the strategic call**
   
   Based on analysis, Rafael decides:
   
   **Build in parallel (90 minutes):**
   - ✅ **Analytics endpoints** (Medium effort, High demo impact)
   - ✅ **Social sharing** (Small effort, Medium demo impact)
   - ✅ **Bug fix** (Small effort, shows quality commitment)
   
   **Defer:**
   - ❌ Search (Large—needs 2-3 weeks)
   - ❌ Architecture refactor (No demo impact, risky)

3. **Map work to interfaces**
   
   Create a sprint plan:
   ```markdown
   ## Sprint Goal (90 minutes)
   Ship 3 demo-ready features.
   
   ## Work Streams (Parallel Execution)
   
   ### Stream 1: Analytics (David)
   - **Interface**: GitHub Web Coding Agent
   - **Why**: Well-defined, can run autonomously
   
   ### Stream 2: Social Sharing (Marcus)
   - **Interface**: VS Code Agent Mode
   - **Why**: Needs design decisions, interactive
   
   ### Stream 3: Bug Fix + Infrastructure (Jordan)
   - **Interface**: Copilot CLI
   - **Why**: Database investigation, scripted fix
   ```

4. **Monitor and adjust**
   
   At 4:30 PM, check progress:
   - Analytics: PR created ✅
   - Social sharing: Component done ✅
   - Bug fix: Migration ready ✅
   
   Make calls: *"Marcus, ship the buttons as-is. Polish later."*

5. **Create the demo narrative**
   
   ```
   Demo Flow (3 minutes):
   
   1. Analytics Dashboard
      "We track engagement: 1,247 quote views this week"
   
   2. Social Sharing
      "Fans share favorite moments to social media"
   
   3. Data Quality
      "Fixed duplicate data, added constraints"
   
   Story: Growth features + quality commitment
   ```

### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Created prioritization matrix with value + effort
- [ ] Made strategic decisions on build vs. defer
- [ ] Decomposed into 3 parallel streams
- [ ] Matched each stream to appropriate interface
- [ ] All 3 streams completed in 90 minutes
- [ ] Created demo narrative connecting to business value

### ✨ The "After" — The Transformation

**Without orchestration**: 90 minutes, nothing shippable  
**With orchestration**: 90 minutes, 3 demo-ready features

The key: Rafael didn't just write requirements. He **orchestrated execution** using AI tools strategically.

### 💭 Rafael's Complete Transformation

*"This is what I've been missing. For years, I wrote requirements and hoped developers would execute them. I was just a requirements writer.*

*Now I understand: Product leadership isn't just WHAT to build—it's orchestrating HOW and WHEN to build it.*

*I used AI to:*
- *Prioritize based on value + realistic effort estimates*
- *Decompose work into parallelizable streams*
- *Match tasks to the right tools and people*
- *Keep everyone focused on shipping*

*I'm not a requirements writer anymore. I'm an **execution enabler**."*

## 🎯 Rafael's Module Summary

### Your Transformation

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Write requirements, hope for execution | Orchestrate parallel streams |
| Estimate by gut feel | AI-assisted effort analysis |
| Sequential: one feature at a time | Parallel: 3 features simultaneously |
| Demo shows "in progress" | Demo shows shipped value |

### The Product Visionary's Win

You now have the skills to:
- **Prioritize strategically** — Value + effort + demo impact
- **Decompose effectively** — Parallelizable work streams
- **Orchestrate agents** — Right interface for right task
- **Maintain focus** — Ship over polish

### The Orchestration Pattern

```
Backlog → Prioritize → Decompose → Assign Interfaces → Monitor → Ship
            ↓             ↓              ↓
         Value +       Parallel      VS Code / Web / CLI
         Effort        Streams
```

# Module 10: Agentic SDLC + Ship

## ⏰ Monday 7:00 PM — Parallel Development Power

> *"We've learned to use agents one at a time. Now let's see what happens when we run them everywhere at once."*  
> — Marcus, ready to unleash the full potential of multi-interface agents

---

## 📖 Overview

You've learned to customize Copilot with instructions, prompts, agents, skills, and MCP servers. But so far, you've been working sequentially—one task at a time, one interface at a time.

**Agentic SDLC** changes that. With agents running across VS Code, GitHub.com, and the CLI simultaneously, you can build features in parallel.

**Time**: ~90 minutes  
**Personas**: Marcus (parallel orchestration), David (architecture review), Rafael (sprint planning), Elena (parallel QA)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Run multiple agents simultaneously across different interfaces
- Use VS Code Agent Mode for complex, interactive development
- Use GitHub Copilot Web (Coding Agent) for background PR workflows
- Use `copilot` CLI for terminal-based automation
- Orchestrate parallel development workflows
- Use checkpoints to safely review and roll back changes

## 📚 Key Concepts

### The Three Agent Interfaces

| Interface | Best For | Runs In |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **VS Code Agent Mode** | Complex, interactive development | Foreground |
| **GitHub Web (Coding Agent)** | Well-defined autonomous tasks | Background |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | Terminal/infrastructure work | Terminal |

### Interface Selection Guide

| Need | Best Interface | Why |
|------|----------------|-----|
| Complex feature with iteration | VS Code Agent Mode | Interactive feedback loop |
| Well-defined task, run autonomously | GitHub Web Coding Agent | Creates PR in background |
| Terminal/DevOps tasks | Copilot CLI | Agentic terminal capabilities |
| Quick questions | Any | All handle explanations well |

### Agent HQ: The Orchestration Dashboard

With VS Code 1.107+, **Agent HQ** becomes your central command for parallel development:

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| **Status Overview** | See all running agents at a glance |
| **Progress Tracking** | Monitor what each agent is working on |
| **Interaction** | Jump into any agent's conversation |
| **Session History** | Archive and reference past agent work |
| **Handoff Control** | Move tasks between local/background/cloud |

**Access**: Command Palette → "Copilot: Open Agent HQ"

This transforms the parallel workflow from "multiple terminal windows" to a true orchestration dashboard.

### The Parallel Workflow (with Agent HQ)

```
Sprint Start
    │
    ├─── VS Code Agent Mode ─────────── (Interactive, you + agent)
    │
    ├─── GitHub Web Agent ────────────── (Background, autonomous)
    │
    └─── Copilot CLI ─────────────────── (Terminal, scripted)
    │
Sprint End ◄── All streams converge
```

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

### What Changed

| Traditional Development | Agentic SDLC |
|------------------------|--------------|
| One task at a time | Multiple tasks in parallel |
| Developer writes code | Developer orchestrates agents |
| Sequential workflow | Parallel workflow |
| Bottleneck: typing speed | Bottleneck: orchestration skill |

### The Productivity Math

```
Sequential: Task A (30 min) + Task B (30 min) + Task C (30 min) = 90 min
Parallel:   Max(Task A, Task B, Task C) + Integration (10 min) = 40 min
Speedup:    2.25x
```

### The New Skills

1. **Task decomposition** — Breaking work into parallelizable chunks
2. **Interface selection** — Choosing the right agent for each task
3. **Context preparation** — Setting up agents for success
4. **Integration** — Merging parallel work streams
5. **Quality review** — Validating agent output before shipping

## 📚 Quick Reference

### Interface Selection

| Task Type | Interface | Why |

| Analytics endpoints | GitHub Web Agent | Well-defined, autonomous |
| Test fixtures | Copilot CLI | Terminal scripting |
| Database migrations | Copilot CLI | Infrastructure |
| Bug fix with investigation | VS Code Agent | Needs human judgment |
| Documentation update | GitHub Web Agent | Straightforward |

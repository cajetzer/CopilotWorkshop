# Module 6: Agent Skills

## ⏰ Monday 4:00 PM — Teaching Copilot Your Domain

> *"Bug reports come in, and I spend half my time reproducing issues before I can even write a test. How do I teach Copilot our testing patterns so it can help me create failing tests faster?"*  
> — Elena, wanting systematic bug reproduction workflows

---

## 🔍 Background: Understanding Agent Skills

### Where Agent Skills Came From

**Agent Skills** is an **open standard** originally developed by Anthropic for their Claude AI assistant. The format proved so useful that it became a cross-tool standard, now documented at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io).

**Key terminology clarification:**

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **"Claude Skills"** | Anthropic's original implementation (you may see this term in older docs) |
| **"Agent Skills"** | The official open standard name (what we use in this training) |
| **"GitHub Skills"** | Not an official term—GitHub adopted the Agent Skills standard |

### GitHub Copilot's Adoption

GitHub Copilot now supports the Agent Skills standard across multiple tools:

- **VS Code** — Skills loaded in chat and agent mode
- **Copilot CLI** — Skills accessible in terminal workflows
- **Copilot coding agent** — Skills used during automated coding tasks

This means skills you create are **portable**—they work across all GitHub Copilot surfaces, not just VS Code.

> ⚠️ **Preview Status**: Agent Skills in VS Code is currently in preview. Enable the `chat.useAgentSkills` setting to use this feature. While the format is stable (it's an open standard), the VS Code integration continues to evolve.

### When to Use What: A Decision Guide

**The simple question**: *"What am I trying to teach Copilot?"*

| I want Copilot to... | Use | Example |
|---------------------|-----|---------|
| **Know our project basics** | Repo Instructions | "This is a React/Node app, use these patterns" |
| **Apply rules to specific files** | Custom Instructions | "For test files, use Jest with these conventions" |
| **Run a specific task I trigger** | Prompts | "Generate a React component with tests" |
| **Act as a specialist persona** | Agents | "Be a security reviewer with read-only access" |
| **Know our domain automatically** | Skills | "Validate TV show data against our schema" |

### The Five Types Compared

| | **Repo Instructions** | **Custom Instructions** | **Prompts** | **Agents** | **Skills** |
|---|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **File** | `copilot-instructions.md` | `*.instructions.md` | `*.prompt.md` | `*.agent.md` | `SKILL.md` |
| **Location** | `.github/` | `.github/instructions/` | `.github/prompts/` | `.github/agents/` | `.github/skills/*/` |
| **Think of it as** | Project README for AI | File-specific rules | Task template | Specialist persona | Domain expert |
| **When loaded** | Always, every request | By file pattern (`applyTo`) | When you invoke it | When you @ mention it | Automatically when relevant |
| **You trigger it by** | Nothing—always on | Opening matching files | Running `/prompt-name` | Typing `@agent-name` | Just asking—Copilot decides |
| **Scope** | Whole repository | Specific file types | Specific task | Role-based workflow | Specialized knowledge |
| **Best for** | Project context | File-type consistency | Repeatability | Autonomy | Expertise |
| **Module** | 1 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 6 |

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine onboarding a new developer:

- **Repo Instructions** = The project overview they read first ("Here's what this app does and our tech stack")
- **Custom Instructions** = Context-specific guidelines ("When working on tests, follow these patterns")
- **Prompts** = Checklists they follow for common tasks ("Use this template when creating a new API endpoint")
- **Agents** = Roles they can take on ("When doing security review, only read code—don't change it")
- **Skills** = Domain knowledge they acquire over time ("Our TV show data has specific validation rules")

### Quick Decision Flowchart

```
Do you want this applied AUTOMATICALLY?
├── YES → Is it project-wide context?
│         ├── YES → Use REPO INSTRUCTIONS (copilot-instructions.md)
│         └── NO → Should it apply to specific file types?
│                   ├── YES → Use CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS (*.instructions.md)
│                   └── NO → Does it need scripts + domain knowledge?
│                             ├── YES → Use SKILLS
│                             └── NO → Use REPO INSTRUCTIONS
└── NO → Do you want a reusable task template?
          ├── YES → Use PROMPTS
          └── NO → Do you want a specialist persona?
                    ├── YES → Use AGENTS
                    └── NO → Just ask Copilot directly!
```

## 📖 The Story So Far

The FanHub team has built an impressive AI collaboration toolkit:
- **Module 1**: Repository instructions and architecture documentation
- **Module 2**: Agent plan mode for systematic thinking
- **Module 3**: Custom prompts for reusable workflows
- **Module 4**: Custom agents for autonomous tasks
- **Module 5**: Custom instructions for file-scoped context

But Elena notices a gap: *"We have general coding standards, but nothing that captures our bug reproduction patterns. When a user reports 'character page shows wrong data,' I want Copilot to help me write a failing test that demonstrates the issue before we fix it."*

Rafael agrees: *"Our product requirements are domain-specific. Skills could encode testing patterns so Copilot applies them consistently when reproducing bugs."*

**This module's mission**: Create specialized Agent Skills that teach Copilot how to reproduce bugs systematically and write effective failing tests.

---

💡 **Plan Mode Integration**: You'll use plan mode to design skill structures, identify domain patterns, and create systematic validation workflows before implementing skills.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand what Agent Skills are and how they differ from instructions and prompts
- Create custom skills with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions
- Include scripts and resources within skill directories
- See how Copilot automatically loads skills when relevant
- Build domain-specific validation skills for the FanHub data model
- Leverage community skills from existing repositories

**Time**: ~90 minutes  
**Personas**: Elena (Quality Champion), Rafael (Product Visionary)

## 🧠 Mindful Moment: The Right Tool for the Job

Think about the hierarchy of Copilot customization:

| Tool | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Instructions** | General standards applied everywhere | "Use async/await, not promises" |
| **Prompts** | Reusable templates for common tasks | "Generate test suite for component" |
| **Agents** | Autonomous multi-step workflows | "Review architecture and suggest improvements" |
| **Skills** | Specialized domain knowledge Copilot loads when needed | "Validate TV show data follows our schema" |

Skills are perfect for domain-specific expertise that's too detailed for instructions but needs to be applied systematically.

---

## 📚 Key Concepts

### What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are folders containing:
- `SKILL.md` file with instructions (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
- Optional scripts, examples, and resources
- Domain-specific knowledge Copilot loads when relevant

Skills are part of an [open standard](https://agentskills.io) supported by GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, and other AI coding tools.

### How Copilot Loads Skills (Progressive Disclosure)

Skills use a three-level loading system to stay efficient:

1. **Level 1: Discovery** — Copilot always knows which skills exist by reading `name` and `description` from YAML frontmatter
2. **Level 2: Instructions** — When your request matches a skill, Copilot loads the full `SKILL.md` body
3. **Level 3: Resources** — Scripts and examples load only when Copilot references them

This means you can have many skills installed without bloating context—only relevant content loads.

### Where Skills Live

**Project Skills** (repository-specific):
- `.github/skills/` (recommended) or `.claude/skills/` (legacy) in your repository
- Shared with everyone working on the project
- Version controlled with your code

**Personal Skills** (across all projects):
- `~/.github/skills/` (recommended) or `~/.claude/skills/` (legacy) in your home directory
- Available in all your projects
- Your personal toolkit

### Skills vs Instructions vs Prompts

| Feature | Instructions | Prompts | Skills |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Loaded** | Always | Manually invoked | Automatically when relevant |
| **Scope** | Broad standards | Specific templates | Specialized tasks |
| **Contains** | Guidelines | Structured queries | Instructions + scripts + examples |
| **Best for** | Team conventions | Repeatable workflows | Domain expertise |

### Community Skills

You don't have to build every skill from scratch. Leverage existing skills:

**Anthropic's Skills Repository**: [github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
- High-quality skills for common development tasks
- Examples: debugging, testing patterns, code review
- Well-documented, ready to use

**GitHub's Awesome Copilot Collection**: [github.com/github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot)
- Community-contributed skills and resources
- Domain-specific examples across different technologies
- Constantly growing with contributions

## 🔨 Exercises

### Exercise 6.1: Understand Skills Through Examples — "Elena Explores the Ecosystem"

#### 📖 The Story

**Elena** (Quality Champion, 8 years) has been exploring how other teams use Agent Skills. She's discovered that the community has already built skills for many common scenarios.

*"Before we build our own skills,"* Elena suggests, *"let's see what already exists. Understanding proven patterns will help us design better skills for FanHub."*

The team gathers to explore community skills and understand the anatomy of a well-designed skill.

#### ❌ The "Before" — What Frustration Looks Like

Without skills, Elena has to repeatedly explain bug reproduction testing patterns:

```
@workspace When a bug report comes in, help me write a failing test:

1. Set up the specific database state that triggers the bug
2. Perform the action that causes the issue
3. Assert the bug occurs (test should FAIL initially)
4. Include the bug report number and expected vs. actual behavior
5. Follow our test structure with describe/it blocks
```

Every time a bug report arrives, she re-explains the same testing workflow. And Copilot doesn't automatically know FanHub's testing conventions.

#### 🎯 Objective

Explore community skills to understand skill structure and identify patterns that apply to FanHub validation needs.

#### 📋 Steps

1. **Explore the Anthropic Skills Repository**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to the Anthropic skills collection:
   ```
   https://github.com/anthropics/skills
   ```
   
   Browse through different skills and notice:
   - How `SKILL.md` files are structured
   - What goes in YAML frontmatter vs. markdown body
   - How skills include examples and guidelines
   - When skills reference external scripts or resources

2. **Explore the Awesome Copilot Collection**
   
   Check out the community-curated collection:
   ```
   https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot
   ```
   
   Look for:
   - Domain-specific skills (testing, DevOps, security)
   - Skills that include validation logic
   - Skills that reference external tools or resources

3. **Use plan mode to analyze skill patterns**
   
   Open Copilot Chat and use plan mode to synthesize what you learned:
   
   ```
   @agent I've explored the Anthropic skills repo and the Awesome Copilot collection. 
   Help me create a framework for designing effective Agent Skills for our FanHub project.
   
   Based on the patterns I observed, help me plan:
   
   1. Anatomy of a good SKILL.md file
      - What makes a clear skill name and description?
      - How detailed should instructions be?
      - When to include examples vs. just guidelines?
   
   2. Skills we might need for FanHub
      - TV show data validation
      - API endpoint consistency checking
      - Test coverage requirements
      - Deployment readiness verification
   
   3. Structure for our first skill: "Bug Reproduction Test Generator"
      - What should be in the frontmatter?
      - What testing patterns to include?
      - How to structure failing tests that demonstrate bugs?
   
   Create a planning document for our FanHub skills library.
   ```

4. **Save your planning results**
   
   Create a documentation file for your skill design planning:
   
   ```
   Create fanhub/docs/SKILLS-DESIGN-PLAN.md with the complete planning framework 
   we developed, including:
   - Skill anatomy best practices
   - List of potential FanHub skills
   - Detailed plan for Bug Reproduction Test Generator skill
   - Guidelines for future skill creation
   ```

5. **Examine a skill structure locally**
   
   Look at the directory structure you'll create:
   ```
   .github/skills/
   └── bug-reproduction-test-generator/
       ├── SKILL.md                    (instructions + frontmatter)
       ├── test-examples/              (example bug reproduction tests)
       └── common-bug-patterns.md      (catalog of typical bugs)
   ```

#### 💭 Elena's Realization

*"Skills are like test fixtures for AI—they provide consistent, repeatable knowledge. The community has already solved common problems. Now we can focus on our domain-specific needs."*

---

### Exercise 6.2: Create Your First Skill — "The Bug Reproduction Test Generator"

#### 📖 The Story

**Elena** is ready to build the team's first custom skill. Based on her research, she's designing a skill that helps write failing tests from bug reports.

**Rafael** joins in: *"This is perfect. Our testing patterns can live in a skill. Then when a user reports 'character page shows duplicate data,' Copilot will know how to write a test that demonstrates the issue."*

Together, they'll create a skill that systematizes bug reproduction.

#### ❌ The "Before" — What Frustration Looks Like

A bug report comes in: *"User sees duplicate 'Jesse Pinkman' entries on the Breaking Bad character page."*

Without a skill, Elena has to manually guide Copilot through the testing pattern:

```
@workspace Write a test that:
1. Seeds the database with duplicate character records
2. Calls GET /api/characters?show_id=1
3. Asserts we get duplicate entries (test should FAIL)
4. Uses describe/it structure
5. Includes setup and teardown
6. References bug report number
```

This takes 5-10 minutes of back-and-forth every time a bug comes in.

#### 🎯 Objective

Create a Bug Reproduction Test Generator skill that teaches Copilot how to write effective failing tests from bug reports.

#### 📋 Steps

1. **Create the skill directory structure**
   
   In your FanHub repository:
   
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/skills/bug-reproduction-test-generator
   ```

2. **Use plan mode to design the skill content**
   
   ```
   @agent Help me create the SKILL.md file for our Bug Reproduction Test Generator skill.
   
   The skill should help write failing tests that reproduce reported bugs. Include:
   
   1. Bug reproduction test structure:
      - describe() blocks with bug context and issue number
      - it() statements describing expected behavior
      - Arrange/Act/Assert pattern
      - Setup and teardown for database state
   
   2. Common bug categories:
      - Data integrity issues (duplicates, orphaned FKs)
      - Null reference errors (deleted records, missing data)
      - Incorrect query results (wrong filtering, missing records)
      - Business logic errors (invalid states allowed)
   
   3. FanHub schema knowledge for test data:
      - Character fields: name, show_id, actor_name, status, bio
      - Episode fields: title, show_id, season_id, episode_number
      - Quote fields: quote_text, show_id, character_id, episode_id
   
   4. Test patterns to include:
      - How to seed problematic test data
      - How to structure assertions that should FAIL
      - How to document expected vs. actual behavior
      - How to reference bug report numbers
   
   Create a properly formatted SKILL.md file with:
   - YAML frontmatter (name, description)
   - Clear instructions for Copilot
   - Examples of bug reproduction tests
   - Guidelines for different bug categories
   ```

3. **Create the SKILL.md file**
   
   Save Copilot's generated content to:
   ```
   .github/skills/bug-reproduction-test-generator/SKILL.md
   ```
   
   Review the completed skill in the examples folder:
   ```
   examples/completed-config/skills/bug-reproduction-test-generator/SKILL.md
   ```
   
   Notice how it includes:
   - Test structure patterns with describe/it blocks
   - Examples of data integrity bugs (duplicates, orphaned FKs)
   - Null reference error patterns
   - Query result issues
   - Business logic validation failures
   
   Each pattern shows:
   - How to set up the bug condition
   - How to trigger the issue
   - How to assert the failure (test should FAIL initially)
   - How to document expected vs. actual behavior

4. **Test the skill with a realistic bug report**
   
   Now give Copilot a real bug report and see the skill in action:
   
   ```
   @workspace A user reports: "The Breaking Bad character page shows duplicate 'Jesse Pinkman' entries."
   
   Write a failing test that reproduces this bug. The test should:
   - Query the characters API for Breaking Bad (show_id: 1)
   - Assert that each character name appears only once
   - Include bug report reference
   ```
   
   **Expected**: Copilot should automatically:
   - Use describe/it structure from the skill
   - Set up test data with duplicate Jesse Pinkman records
   - Write assertions that FAIL (catching the bug)
   - Include the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern
   - Reference the bug report in comments

5. **Verify the skill is being used**
   
   Check that Copilot recognizes your skill:
   
   ```
   @workspace What skills do you have for testing and bug reproduction?
   ```
   
   Copilot should mention the bug-reproduction-test-generator skill.

6. **Test with a different bug category**
   
   Try another bug type to see skill versatility:
   
   ```
   @workspace Write a test that reproduces this bug: "API crashes when fetching 
   quotes for a deleted character. Expected: Should return empty array or handle 
   gracefully. Actual: 500 error."
   ```
   
   The skill should guide Copilot to create a null reference error test.

#### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Created `.github/skills/bug-reproduction-test-generator/` directory
- [ ] Created properly formatted `SKILL.md` with frontmatter and instructions
- [ ] Included test patterns for different bug categories
- [ ] Documented testing structure and assertion patterns clearly
- [ ] Tested skill with a real bug report (duplicate characters)
- [ ] Verified Copilot uses the skill automatically when reproducing bugs
- [ ] Skill generates failing tests that demonstrate the issue

#### ✨ The "After" — The Improved Experience

Now when a bug report comes in:
- **Automatic test structure** following FanHub conventions
- **Consistent Arrange/Act/Assert** pattern
- **Proper test data setup** that triggers the bug
- **Clear documentation** of expected vs. actual behavior
- **Bug references** included automatically

**Before the skill**: 5-10 minutes per bug to write a failing test  
**After the skill**: 30 seconds to describe the bug, Copilot writes the test

**Value unlocked**: Elena can reproduce bugs 10x faster, spending her expertise on test strategy rather than boilerplate.

#### 💭 Elena's Transformation

*"This is what I've been missing! The skill captures our testing workflow—how to structure tests, what to assert, how to reference bugs. Now when a user reports 'page shows wrong data,' I just describe the issue and Copilot writes a failing test that proves the bug exists. My 8 years of testing experience is encoded in this skill."*

---

### Exercise 6.3: Create Domain-Specific Skills — "Rafael's Product Requirements Skill"

#### 📖 The Story

**Rafael** (Product Visionary, 10 years) has been watching Elena's success with the bug reproduction skill. He realizes that skills could encode product requirements in a way that bridges the gap between business needs and technical implementation.

*"We have requirements documents that developers read once and forget,"* Rafael reflects. *"What if those requirements lived in skills? Then Copilot would apply them automatically."*

Rafael wants to create a skill that ensures all FanHub features meet product standards.

#### ❌ The "Before" — What Frustration Looks Like

Rafael writes requirements like:
- "All public pages must include error boundaries"
- "Loading states should show skeleton screens, not spinners"
- "User actions must include success/error toast notifications"
- "Analytics tracking on all user interactions"

But developers forget these requirements, and they don't appear until code review—wasting time and causing rework.

#### 🎯 Objective

Create a Feature Requirements Skill that encodes product standards Copilot applies when building new features.

#### 📋 Steps

1. **Create the skill directory structure**
   
   In your FanHub repository:
   
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/skills/feature-requirements
   ```

2. **Use plan mode to design the skill content**
   
   ```
   @agent Help me create a Feature Requirements skill that ensures all FanHub 
   features meet our product standards.
   
   The skill should capture product requirements for:
   
   1. Error Handling
      - Error boundaries for public pages
      - Try-catch for async operations
      - User-friendly error messages
      - Error logging in development
   
   2. User Feedback
      - Loading states (skeleton screens preferred)
      - Success/error toast notifications
      - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   
   3. Analytics & Tracking
      - Page view tracking on component mount
      - User event tracking (clicks, form submissions)
      - Consistent naming convention: fanhub_[page]_[action]
   
   4. Accessibility
      - Semantic HTML elements
      - ARIA labels where needed
      - Keyboard navigation support
      - Focus management
   
   5. Responsive Design
      - Mobile-first approach
      - Standard breakpoints (640px, 768px, 1024px)
      - Touch-friendly targets (min 44px)
   
   Create a properly formatted SKILL.md file with:
   - YAML frontmatter (name, description)
   - Clear instructions for each category
   - Code examples where helpful
   - "When to Apply" guidance
   ```

3. **Create the SKILL.md file**
   
   Save Copilot's generated content to:
   ```
   .github/skills/feature-requirements/SKILL.md
   ```
   
   Review the completed skill in the examples folder:
   ```
   examples/completed-config/skills/feature-requirements/SKILL.md
   ```
   
   Notice how it includes:
   - All 5 product requirement categories
   - Specific guidelines for each (error boundaries, skeleton screens, etc.)
   - Code examples for error handling and analytics
   - Clear "When to Apply" section
   
   The skill bridges Rafael's product vision with implementation details developers need.

4. **Test the skill with a real feature**
   
   Now Rafael describes a feature in **product language** (user needs, not technical specs):
   
   ```
   @workspace Users want to discover episodes from their favorite shows. Create a 
   page component where they can browse episodes, filter by season, and click through 
   to see episode details. This should feel polished and professional.
   ```
   
   **Watch the skill bridge product to engineering** - Copilot should automatically add:
   - ✅ Error boundaries (Rafael never mentioned this)
   - ✅ Skeleton loading states while fetching data (Rafael said "polished")
   - ✅ Toast notifications for errors (Rafael said "professional")
   - ✅ Analytics tracking for page views and episode clicks (auto-applied)
   - ✅ Semantic HTML with ARIA labels for screen readers (auto-applied)
   - ✅ Responsive layout that works on mobile (auto-applied)
   - ✅ Keyboard navigation support (auto-applied)
   
   **This is the value**: Rafael speaks business language ("users want to discover"), 
   the skill translates to engineering standards automatically.

5. **Compare with and without the skill**
   
   To see the difference, temporarily rename the skill folder:
   
   ```bash
   mv .github/skills/feature-requirements .github/skills/feature-requirements-disabled
   ```
   
   Reload VS Code, then ask the same question. Notice:
   - No error boundaries mentioned
   - Basic loading spinner instead of skeleton screens
   - No analytics tracking
   - Missing accessibility features
   
   Rename it back and reload:
   
   ```bash
   mv .github/skills/feature-requirements-disabled .github/skills/feature-requirements
   ```
   
   **This demonstrates**: The skill encodes Rafael's product standards as automatic behavior.

6. **Verify the skill is being used**
   
   Check that Copilot recognizes your skill:
   
   ```
   @workspace What skills do you have for building features and components?
   ```
   
   Copilot should mention the feature-requirements skill.

7. **Document the skill in your team standards**
   
   Update your `copilot-instructions.md` to reference the skill:
   
   ```markdown
   ## Product Standards
   
   All features must meet requirements documented in the `feature-requirements` skill.
   Copilot will automatically apply these when creating new components and pages.
   ```

#### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Created `.github/skills/feature-requirements/` directory
- [ ] Used plan mode to design the skill structure
- [ ] Created properly formatted `SKILL.md` with all 5 requirement categories
- [ ] Included examples for error handling and analytics
- [ ] Tested skill using product language (no technical specs mentioned)
- [ ] Verified Copilot auto-applies technical standards from product descriptions
- [ ] Compared behavior with skill enabled vs. disabled
- [ ] Updated team instructions to reference the skill

#### ✨ The "After" — The Improved Experience

Rafael's product requirements are now:
- **Automatically applied** when building features
- **Version controlled** with the codebase
- **Consistently enforced** by AI assistance
- **Living documentation** that evolves with the product

**Before the skill**: 
- Rafael: "Users want to browse episodes"
- Developer: "Should I add error boundaries? Analytics? Loading states?"
- Rafael: *checks PRD* "Uh, yes... let me find the standards doc..."

**After the skill**: 
- Rafael: "Users want to browse episodes"
- Copilot: *Automatically adds error boundaries, skeleton screens, analytics, a11y, responsive design*
- Developer: ✅ Ships polished feature matching product standards

**Value unlocked**: Product standards become executable. Rafael speaks user needs, the skill ensures technical excellence. No more "forgot to add analytics" in code review.

#### 💭 Rafael's Transformation

*"This changes everything. Requirements aren't just documents developers read once—they're living knowledge that Copilot applies every time. The gap between product and engineering just got a lot smaller."*

---

### Exercise 6.4: Effort Estimator Skill — "Rafael Makes Informed Tradeoffs"

#### 📖 The Story

**Rafael** just left a brutal stakeholder meeting. He has 10 feature requests, and his boss asked: *"Which should we build first?"*

Without technical knowledge, Rafael guessed: *"The search feature seems simple, right? It's just a text box."*

**Marcus** (sitting beside him) winces: *"Search needs database indexing, relevance ranking, autocomplete with debouncing, pagination, highlighting... that's 2-3 weeks of work, minimum."*

**Rafael's face falls**: *"I just told my boss we'd ship it next week. I promised stakeholders..."*

Later, Rafael reflects: *"I need AI to help me understand technical complexity BEFORE I commit to stakeholders. I can't keep making promises I can't keep."*

**Supporting Cast**: Marcus helps Rafael understand what makes features complex from an engineering perspective.

#### ❌ The "Before" — What Frustration Looks Like

Rafael's stakeholder meeting backlog:

1. "Add character favorites" → Rafael thinks: *Easy, it's just a heart icon*
2. "Implement full-text search" → Rafael thinks: *Simple, one text input*
3. "Add quote sharing to social media" → Rafael thinks: *Social share buttons, 1 day?*
4. "Create admin dashboard for content moderation" → Rafael thinks: *Admin pages, maybe a week?*

Rafael prioritizes based on business value alone:
- **P0**: Search (high user demand, "seems simple")
- **P1**: Admin dashboard (compliance requirement)
- **P2**: Social sharing
- **P3**: Favorites

**Reality check from Marcus**:
- Search: 2-3 weeks (complex)
- Admin dashboard: 3-4 weeks (auth, roles, moderation workflows)
- Social sharing: 3-5 days (just API integration)
- Favorites: 1 week (backend + frontend + persistence)

Rafael's estimate: "3 weeks total"  
Actual effort: "8-10 weeks total"

**The stakeholder call next week**: "Why isn't search done? You said it was simple!"

#### 🎯 Objective

Create an Effort Estimator skill that analyzes feature descriptions and provides technical effort estimates, helping Rafael make informed prioritization decisions based on value AND cost.

#### 📋 Steps

1. **Use plan mode to design the effort estimator**
   
   ```
   @agent Help me design an Agent Skill for FanHub that estimates technical effort for feature requests.
   
   The skill should:
   1. Analyze a feature description (written in product language)
   2. Reference our ARCHITECTURE.md to understand our tech stack
   3. Identify technical components needed:
      - Database changes (new tables, migrations, schema updates)
      - Backend changes (new routes, services, business logic)
      - Frontend changes (new pages, components, state management)
      - Testing requirements (unit, integration, e2e)
      - Infrastructure needs (new services, scaling considerations)
   4. Categorize effort as:
      - **Small**: < 3 days (1-5 story points)
      - **Medium**: 3-7 days (8-13 story points)
      - **Large**: 1-2 weeks (21+ story points)
      - **Extra Large**: > 2 weeks (requires breakdown)
   5. Flag risks and complexity factors:
      - Performance implications
      - Security concerns
      - Breaking changes
      - External dependencies
      - Unknown unknowns
   
   Output should be:
   - Effort estimate with confidence level
   - Breakdown by discipline (backend, frontend, testing, etc.)
   - Risks and dependencies
   - Recommendations for breaking down large features
   
   Create a planning document for this skill structure.
   ```

2. **Create the skill directory and SKILL.md**
   
   Using Agent mode or manually:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p fanhub/.github/skills/effort-estimator
   ```
   
   Then ask Copilot:
   ```
   @agent Create .github/skills/effort-estimator/SKILL.md based on our planning document.
   
   The skill should:
   - Have YAML frontmatter with name, description, and level: 2
   - Include sections for: effort categories, complexity factors, estimation framework
   - Provide examples of Small, Medium, and Large features from FanHub domain
   - Reference ARCHITECTURE.md for tech stack context
   - Output a structured estimation report format
   ```

3. **Add example feature breakdowns**
   
   The skill should include examples like:
   
   **Example: "Add full-text search"**
   - Backend: Search endpoint, query optimization, indexing strategy (Medium)
   - Frontend: Search bar component, results page, autocomplete (Medium)
   - Testing: Search relevance tests, performance tests (Small)
   - Infrastructure: Consider search indexing service (Risk: scaling)
   - **Total**: Large (2-3 weeks)
   - **Risks**: Performance at scale, relevance tuning, indexing strategy
   
   **Example: "Add social media share buttons"**
   - Backend: No changes needed (Small)
   - Frontend: Share button component, social meta tags (Small)
   - Testing: Share link validation (Small)
   - **Total**: Small (2-3 days)
   - **Risks**: Minimal

4. **Test the skill with Rafael's backlog**
   
   With the skill installed, ask Copilot:
   ```
   Estimate the technical effort for these features:
   
   1. "Users want to favorite quotes and view them on a dedicated favorites page"
   2. "Users want to search across all shows, characters, and quotes with autocomplete"
   3. "Users want to share quotes to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram"
   4. "Admins need a dashboard to moderate user-submitted content with approval workflow"
   ```
   
   Copilot should automatically use the Effort Estimator skill and provide:
   - Size estimate for each
   - Technical breakdown
   - Risk assessment
   - Prioritization recommendations

5. **Create a prioritization matrix**
   
   Ask Copilot to help Rafael prioritize:
   ```
   Using the effort estimates, help me create a prioritization matrix.
   
   Business Value (Rafael's input):
   - Favorites: Medium (nice-to-have)
   - Search: High (most requested feature)
   - Social sharing: Low (marketing team request)
   - Admin moderation: High (compliance requirement)
   
   Create a 2x2 matrix: Business Value vs. Technical Effort
   Recommend which to build first for a 4-week sprint.
   ```

#### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Created `.github/skills/effort-estimator/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Skill includes effort categories (Small/Medium/Large/XL)
- [ ] Skill references ARCHITECTURE.md for tech stack context
- [ ] Skill provides structured output with effort breakdown
- [ ] Tested with 4+ feature descriptions
- [ ] Copilot automatically applies the skill when estimating effort
- [ ] Generated a prioritization matrix based on value + effort
- [ ] Compared Rafael's initial guesses vs. skill-informed estimates

#### ✨ The "After" — The Improved Experience

Rafael's new stakeholder meeting workflow:

**Before the skill:**
- Stakeholder: "How long will search take?"
- Rafael: "Uh... a week? Maybe two?"
- Stakeholder: "Great, let's commit to next sprint."
- Rafael: *Fingers crossed*

**After the skill:**
- Stakeholder: "How long will search take?"
- Rafael: *Asks Copilot with effort estimator skill*
- Rafael: "Search is a Large feature—2-3 weeks. It requires backend indexing, frontend autocomplete, and performance optimization. However, social sharing is Small—just 2-3 days. We could ship social sharing THIS sprint and start search next sprint."
- Stakeholder: "That makes sense. Let's do the quick win first."
- Rafael: *Confident, informed, credible*

**Value unlocked:**
- **Fewer broken promises** — Rafael commits based on real estimates
- **Better prioritization** — Value AND effort inform decisions
- **Credibility with stakeholders** — Rafael speaks with technical understanding
- **Smarter roadmaps** — Quick wins vs. strategic bets, consciously chosen

#### 💭 Rafael's Breakthrough

*"For years, I've felt like I'm guessing when I commit to timelines. Developers would roll their eyes when I said 'this seems simple.' Now I can ask Copilot to estimate effort using our actual architecture, and I show up to stakeholder meetings with informed, credible estimates. I'm not just a requirements writer anymore—I'm a strategic planner who understands the technical landscape."*

#### 🚀 Challenge Extension

Enhance the effort estimator to:
- Compare similar features you've built in the past ("Favorites is like Watchlist, which took 6 days")
- Factor in team capacity ("With 2 frontend developers, estimate delivery date")
- Suggest MVP vs. full-featured versions ("Ship basic search in 1 week, add advanced filters later")
- Track actual vs. estimated effort to improve future estimates

### Exercise 6.5: Skills Library Strategy — "Building Your Team's Skill Ecosystem"

#### 📖 The Story

The FanHub team now has two powerful skills:
- **Bug Reproduction Test Generator** (Elena's testing expertise)
- **Feature Requirements** (Rafael's product standards)

Sarah brings the team together: *"We're starting to build a skills library. Let's be systematic about this—what other skills do we need? How do we organize them? How do we keep them maintained?"*

This is the team's opportunity to plan their complete skills ecosystem.

#### 🎯 Objective

Create a comprehensive strategy for FanHub's skills library, including additional skills to build and maintenance practices.

#### 📋 Steps

1. **Use plan mode to design your skills ecosystem**
   
   ```
   @agent Help create a comprehensive skills strategy for the FanHub team.
   
   We currently have:
   - bug-reproduction-test-generator (test-driven debugging)
   - feature-requirements (product standards)
   
   Plan our complete skills library:
   
   1. Identify additional skills we need:
      - What other domain knowledge should be encoded?
      - What repetitive validation or checking tasks occur?
      - What team standards aren't captured yet?
   
   2. Organize our skills:
      - How should skills be categorized?
      - Which should be project skills vs. personal skills?
      - How do skills relate to our instructions and prompts?
   
   3. Maintenance strategy:
      - How do we keep skills up to date?
      - Who owns which skills?
      - How do we test that skills work correctly?
      - When do we deprecate or refactor skills?
   
   4. Community integration:
      - Which community skills should we adopt?
      - How do we customize community skills for our needs?
      - Should we contribute our skills back?
   
   Create a complete Skills Library Strategy document.
   ```

2. **Identify candidate skills for FanHub**
   
   Brainstorm additional skills the team might need:
   
   - **API Endpoint Design Skill**: Consistent REST conventions
   - **Test Coverage Checker**: Ensure adequate test coverage
   - **Deployment Readiness**: Pre-deploy validation checklist
   - **Database Migration Skill**: Safe schema changes
   - **Security Review Skill**: Common vulnerability checks
   - **Performance Optimization Skill**: Best practices for React/Node

3. **Create your skills library documentation**
   
   ```
   Create fanhub/docs/SKILLS-LIBRARY-STRATEGY.md documenting:
   - Complete list of planned skills (current + future)
   - Skill ownership and maintenance responsibilities
   - Guidelines for when to create new skills
   - Testing and validation approach
   - Integration with instructions and prompts
   - Community skills we're adopting
   - Contribution guidelines for new skills
   ```

4. **Set up personal skills**
   
   Team members can create personal skills for their own workflow:
   
   ```bash
   # Elena might create personal testing skills
   mkdir -p ~/.copilot/skills/comprehensive-test-generator
   
   # Marcus might create personal DevOps skills
   mkdir -p ~/.copilot/skills/infrastructure-review
   ```

5. **Adopt a community skill**
   
   Pick one skill from the Anthropic or Awesome Copilot repos to adopt:
   
   ```bash
   # Example: Adopt a debugging skill
   cp -r /path/to/community/skill .github/skills/debugging-workflow
   # Customize it for FanHub's needs
   ```

6. **Create skill discovery documentation**
   
   Add to your README or docs:
   
   ```markdown
   ## Available Skills
   
   FanHub uses Agent Skills to provide domain-specific expertise:
   
   ### Project Skills (.github/skills/)
   - **bug-reproduction-test-generator**: Generates failing tests from bug reports
   - **feature-requirements**: Ensures features meet product standards
   - **[your additional skills]**
   
   ### Community Skills We Use
   - Link to adopted community skills
   
   ### How to Add New Skills
   - Guidelines for team members to contribute skills
   ```

#### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Created comprehensive Skills Library Strategy document
- [ ] Identified 4-6 additional skills to build
- [ ] Documented skill ownership and maintenance approach
- [ ] Set up at least one personal skill
- [ ] Adopted at least one community skill
- [ ] Created skill discovery documentation for the team

#### ✨ The "After" — The Complete Ecosystem

The FanHub team now has:
- **Systematic approach** to encoding expertise
- **Clear ownership** of different skills
- **Integration plan** between skills, instructions, and prompts
- **Maintenance strategy** for keeping skills current
- **Community connection** leveraging and contributing skills

**Key insight**: Skills are most powerful when part of a systematic strategy, not ad-hoc additions.

#### 💭 Team Reflection

- **Sarah**: *"Skills are the missing piece. They scale expertise across the team."*
- **Elena**: *"My domain knowledge is now executable, not just documentation."*
- **Rafael**: *"Product requirements become code assistance, not just PRD documents."*
- **David**: *"This is how we preserve institutional knowledge as AI-accessible."*

## 🎯 Module Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Skills encode domain expertise** that's too specific for instructions but needs systematic application
2. **Community skills** provide proven patterns you can adopt and customize
3. **Skills + Instructions + Prompts** form a complete customization strategy
4. **Plan mode helps design skills** systematically before implementation
5. **Skills libraries scale knowledge** across entire teams

### Practices Mastered

| Practice | Key Insight |
|----------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Domain Knowledge as Code** | Skills make expertise executable and version-controlled |
| 📚 **Community Leverage** | Don't build everything—adopt and customize proven skills |
| 🔄 **Systematic Design** | Use plan mode to design skill structure before implementation |
| 🏗️ **Skills Ecosystem** | Think libraries, not individual skills—systematic approach wins |

### The Customization Hierarchy (Complete)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Instructions (.github/)            │  ← Always loaded, broad standards
├─────────────────────────────────────┤

```

### What's Next

In **Module 7: MCP Servers**, you'll learn how to connect Copilot to external systems—databases, APIs, and deployment infrastructure. Elena's bug reproduction skill knows the TESTING PATTERNS, but MCP gives it access to query the ACTUAL DATABASE to understand what data is causing bugs. Jordan shows the team how MCP (Model Context Protocol) supercharges skills with real-time data access.

**💡 Plan Mode Tip for Next Module**: Before adding MCP servers, use plan mode to identify which external systems Copilot should connect to and what security constraints apply.

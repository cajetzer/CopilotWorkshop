# Module 3: Custom Prompts

## ⏰ Monday 12:00 PM — Building Reusable Tools

> *"Every time I write the same prompt explaining how we test, I think: there has to be a better way."*  
> — Elena, watching the team manually re-type similar prompts for the fifth time

## 📖 The Story

Module 1 gave the team **foundations**: David documented the architecture, Marcus created team standards in `copilot-instructions.md`. Module 2 introduced **structured thinking**: Sarah, David, and Marcus learned to use plan mode for systematic AI collaboration.

Now Sarah notices something: Everyone keeps writing the same kinds of prompts over and over.

- Elena explains testing requirements each time she asks for tests
- Rafael describes the same acceptance criteria format for every feature
- Marcus types the same "create an endpoint" instructions repeatedly

*"What if we could save these prompts and share them?"* Sarah asks. *"Like functions, but for AI instructions. And what if we used our new planning skills to design them properly?"*

**This module's mission**: Create a prompt library that turns repetitive work into reusable tools, using plan mode to design them systematically.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Create reusable prompt files (`.github/prompts/`)
- Use variables to make prompts flexible
- Reference documentation in prompts for consistent context
- Experience multi-modal workflows (VS Code + GitHub.com)

**Time**: ~90 minutes (or follow your persona's focused path for less)  
**Featured Personas**: Elena (QA), Rafael (Product), Marcus (DevOps), Jordan (Platform)

## 🧠 Mindful Moment: Prompts Are Functions

Think about how code evolved:
- **1950s**: Repeat the same assembly instructions everywhere
- **1960s**: Functions let you write once, call many times
- **2020s**: Prompts are the new functions—but most people are still copy-pasting

The teams that win with AI are building **prompt libraries**, not typing the same instructions repeatedly.

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Custom Prompt Files

GitHub Copilot can use prompt files stored in `.github/prompts/`. These files:
- Are written in Markdown
- Can include variables (`{{variable_name}}`)
- Can reference other files
- Are shareable across the team

**How to use them:**
1. Create `.github/prompts/my-prompt.prompt.md`
2. In Copilot Chat, type `/` and select your prompt
3. Fill in any variables
4. Execute with full context

### Chat Participants

Copilot Chat has specialized "participants" you can invoke:
- `@workspace` — Understands your entire project
- `@vscode` — Knows about VS Code features and settings
- `@terminal` — Can run and explain terminal commands

Combine these with prompt files for powerful workflows.

### Multi-Modal: VS Code + GitHub.com

Copilot isn't just in your editor. On GitHub.com:
- **PR Reviews**: Ask Copilot to review your code changes
- **Issue Analysis**: Get implementation suggestions from issue descriptions
- **Code Search**: Natural language queries across repositories

We'll use both modes in this module.

## 🎯 Choose Your Path

### Option 1: Follow Your Persona

Pick the path that matches your role and interests:

- **[Elena's Path](personas/elena.md)** — Test generation and quality assurance (60 min)
- **[Rafael's Path](personas/rafael.md)** — Requirements translation and specifications (60 min)
- **[Marcus's Path](personas/marcus.md)** — Backend API patterns (30 min)
- **[Jordan's Path](personas/jordan.md)** — Git workflow automation (30 min)

Each persona path includes:
- Your focused exercises
- Collaboration points with other personas
- Your specific transformation arc

### Option 2: Experience the Full Story

Work through all exercises in narrative order to experience the full team journey:

**[View All Exercises →](EXERCISES.md)**

This path includes:
- Complete team collaboration narrative
- All four persona perspectives
- Full module content (~90 minutes)

### Option 3: Quick Navigator

## ➡️ Next Up

**[Module 4: Custom Agents](../04-custom-agents/README.md)** (Monday 1:30 PM)

The team has patterns, documentation, and prompts. Now it's time to let Copilot work autonomously. David will create an Architecture Reviewer agent, Jordan will build DevOps automation, and we'll explore how agents can run in the background while you work on other things.

# Character Detail Challenge — Tracking Document

> **Purpose**: This document tracks your progress through the "Golden Thread" — a feature challenge that spans the entire workshop. Each module adds more context, and you'll see Copilot's suggestions improve dramatically.

## The Challenge

Build a **Character Detail page** for FanHub that displays:
- Character name, photo, and bio
- Episode appearances with links
- Notable quotes
- Related characters from the same show
- Favorite toggle (persisted to localStorage)
